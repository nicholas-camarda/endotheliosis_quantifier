# Code Style Standards

## Core Principles

### 1. **Code Organization**
- Organize code logically and consistently
- Use descriptive names for files, functions, and variables
- Group related functionality together
- Keep directory structures simple and clear

### 2. **Formatting and Style**
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Keep code readable and maintainable

### 3. **Documentation**
- Document complex logic with clear comments
- Explain the purpose of functions and important code blocks
- Keep documentation simple and focused
- Update documentation when code changes

### 4. **Best Practices**
- Write code that's easy to understand
- Reuse existing functionality when appropriate
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Test your code with realistic data

## Language-Specific Guides

For detailed language-specific standards, see:
- **[R Style](./code-style/r-style.md)** - R coding and testing standards
- **[Python Style](./code-style/python-style.md)** - Python coding and testing standards  
- **[JavaScript Style](./code-style/javascript-style.md)** - JavaScript coding and testing standards

## General Guidelines

### File Organization
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Organize files in logical directory structures
- Keep related files together
- Use consistent naming patterns

### Code Structure
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write code that's easy to read and understand
- Document complex algorithms or business logic

### Comments and Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Explain the "why" behind important decisions
- Keep comments concise and relevant
- Update comments when code changes

## Best Practices Summary

- **Simplicity**: Prefer clear, simple solutions
- **Consistency**: Use consistent patterns throughout
- **Readability**: Write code that's easy to understand
- **Maintainability**: Structure code for easy modification
- **Effectiveness**: Choose approaches that work well
