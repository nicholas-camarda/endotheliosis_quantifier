# Development Methodology

## Core Principles

### 1. **Function Organization**
- Each function should have a single, clear purpose
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Use descriptive names that indicate what the function does
- Document the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each function

### 2. **Code Quality**
- Write readable, maintainable code
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Reuse existing functionality when possible
- Test the actual behavior with realistic data

### 3. **Testing Approach**
- Before testing, ask: "What's the minimum needed to answer this question?"
- Test the specific functionality being evaluated
- Use realistic test data that represents real usage
- Focus on outcomes that matter

### 4. **Documentation**
- Document the purpose and usage of functions
- Keep documentation simple and focused
- Update documentation when code changes
- Include examples for complex functionality

### 5. **Development Workflow**
- Use appropriate tools for the task
- Write code when needed, use tools when appropriate
- Focus on solving the problem effectively
- Keep changes focused and logical

## AI Tool Usage

### **Context7 for Documentation**
- Use Context7 to get up-to-date documentation for libraries and frameworks
- Use Context7 when implementing new patterns or approaches
- Use Context7 to verify current best practices
- Use Context7 for language-specific examples and syntax

### **Sequential-Thinking for Planning**
- Use sequential-thinking when planning development strategies
- Use sequential-thinking to break down complex problems
- Use sequential-thinking to identify potential issues and risks
- Use sequential-thinking to plan implementation approaches

### **When to Use These Tools**
- Before starting any development task
- When choosing between implementation approaches
- When debugging complex issues
- When implementing new features or patterns
- When working with unfamiliar libraries or frameworks
- When planning testing strategies

## Testing Guidelines

### When to Test
- Test new functionality
- Test critical business logic
- Test when debugging issues
- Test when refactoring important code

### How to Test
- Use the appropriate testing framework for your language
- Test actual behavior with realistic data
- Keep tests focused and minimal
- Test both success and error cases when relevant

### Effective Testing Practices
- Test functions that contain business logic
- Test functions that handle data transformation
- Test functions that interact with external systems
- Test functions that contain complex algorithms

## Best Practices

- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, clear solutions over complex ones
- **Focus**: Work on one thing at a time
- **Effectiveness**: Choose the approach that gets the job done well
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to understand and modify
- **Clarity**: Make your intent clear in both code and tests
