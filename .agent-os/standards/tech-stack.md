# Tech Stack Standards

## Core Principles

### 1. **Technology Selection**
- Choose appropriate technologies for the project requirements
- Use established, well-supported frameworks and libraries
- Consider maintainability and team expertise
- Prefer simple, effective solutions over complex ones

### 2. **Consistency**
- Use consistent technology choices within projects
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain compatibility between components
- Use appropriate versions and dependencies

### 3. **Flexibility**
- Adapt technology choices to project needs
- Consider project-specific requirements
- Use appropriate tools for the task at hand
- Balance standardization with project-specific needs

## Default Technology Stack

For web application projects, consider these established technologies:

### Backend
- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails, Django, Express.js, or similar
- **Language**: Ruby, Python, JavaScript/Node.js, or similar
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar relational database
- **ORM**: Active Record, SQLAlchemy, Prisma, or similar

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React, Vue, or similar
- **Build Tool**: Vite, Webpack, or similar
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, or similar
- **CSS Framework**: TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, or similar

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, etc.)
- **Database Hosting**: Managed database services
- **Asset Storage**: Cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar

## Best Practices

- **Simplicity**: Choose technologies that are easy to understand and maintain
- **Documentation**: Use well-documented frameworks and libraries
- **Community Support**: Prefer technologies with active communities
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of technology choices
- **Security**: Use technologies with good security practices

## Project-Specific Adaptation

- Adapt technology choices to project requirements
- Consider team expertise and learning curves
- Balance standardization with project-specific needs
- Document technology decisions and rationale
