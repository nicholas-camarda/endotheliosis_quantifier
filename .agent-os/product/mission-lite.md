# Endotheliosis Quantifier (EQ) - Mission Lite

**Product**: Medical image analysis pipeline for quantifying endotheliosis in preeclampsia histology images

**Core Value**: Automated segmentation and quantification of kidney pathology using transfer learning from mitochondria to glomeruli

**Users**: Medical researchers, pathologists, computational biologists

**Key Features**: 
- Mitochondria pre-training on EM data
- Glomeruli transfer learning on H&E images  
- Endotheliosis quantification (0-3 scale)
- Complete end-to-end pipeline
- Hardware-optimized execution

**Current State**: FastAI v1 codebase being modernized to v2, needs end-to-end testing and quantification model completion

**Goal**: Download → point at data → run complete pipeline with transparent parameters and lab notebook documentation
