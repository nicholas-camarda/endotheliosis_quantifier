# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @~/.agent-os/specs/2025-08-22-glomeruli-evaluation-pipeline/2025-08-22-glomeruli-evaluation-pipeline.md

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All development, testing, and execution MUST be performed with the 'eq' conda environment activated.**

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Code Review and Analysis**: Review existing glomeruli transfer learning implementation to understand current state and identify issues
- **Transfer Learning Reimplementation**: Reimplement glomeruli training through transfer learning from mitochondria-pretrained model using current code standards
- **Model Training**: Train glomeruli segmentation model on preeclampsia data using mitochondria-pretrained weights as starting point
- **Model Loading**: Load mitochondria-pretrained model as the foundation for transfer learning
- **Data Integration**: Use existing preeclampsia validation data configuration from `configs/glomeruli_finetuning_config.yaml`
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Implement evaluation stage that mirrors mitochondria evaluation methodology exactly
- **Metrics Calculation**: Compute Dice Score, IoU Score, and Pixel Accuracy on all validation samples
- **Visualization**: Generate sample prediction plots showing image, ground truth, and prediction
- **Testing Integration**: Include proper testing indicators and QUICK_TEST mode support

### Integration Points
- **Glomeruli Segmentation Pipeline**: Add evaluation branch to existing glomeruli stage in `src/eq/pipeline/segmentation_pipeline.py`
- **Configuration System**: Leverage existing glomeruli configuration for data paths and model settings
- **Output Management**: Use existing output directory system and logging infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: Integrate with existing test suite and validation procedures

### Performance Requirements
- **Evaluation Speed**: Complete evaluation on validation set within reasonable time (similar to mitochondria)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Handle validation data without excessive memory usage
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results across multiple evaluation runs
- **Testing Mode**: Support QUICK_TEST mode for faster execution during development

### Output Requirements
- **Quantitative Results**: Comprehensive metrics summary with statistical measures (mean, std, sample count)
- **Visual Outputs**: Sample prediction plots with proper testing indicators
- **Evaluation Summary**: Detailed text summary saved to output directory
- **Testing Indicators**: Clear labeling for testing runs and QUICK_TEST mode

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

**No new external dependencies required** - The implementation will use existing libraries and frameworks already in the project:
- FastAI for model loading and inference
- NumPy for numerical computations and metrics calculation
- Matplotlib for visualization and plotting
- Existing data loading and preprocessing utilities
- Current configuration and output management systems

**Justification**: The goal is to mirror the successful mitochondria approach exactly, which means reusing all existing dependencies and patterns rather than introducing new ones.
