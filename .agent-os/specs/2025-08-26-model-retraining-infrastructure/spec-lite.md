# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement FastAI v2 compatible retraining scripts for both mitochondria and glomeruli models, and reorganize training infrastructure to separate training scripts from pipeline execution scripts. Create mitochondria retraining script based on historical approach, establish proper training workflow with validation monitoring, and ensure new models integrate with existing inference pipeline to achieve expected 70-90%+ detection rates.
