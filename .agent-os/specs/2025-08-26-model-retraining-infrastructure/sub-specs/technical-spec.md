# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-model-retraining-infrastructure/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **FastAI v2 Compatibility**: All training scripts must use FastAI v2 syntax and APIs, ensuring compatibility with current environment
- **Historical Approach Preservation**: Maintain the original training methodology from `segment_mitochondria.py` and `segment_glomeruli.py` while adapting to FastAI v2
- **Two-Phase Training**: Implement mitochondria training first, then glomeruli training using mitochondria model as base (transfer learning)
- **Performance Validation**: Include validation accuracy monitoring and model performance evaluation during training
- **Script Organization**: Separate training scripts from pipeline execution scripts with clear naming conventions
- **Model Integration**: Ensure new models can be loaded and used by existing inference pipeline without breaking changes
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging for training process
- **Configuration Management**: Use existing config files and environment settings for training parameters

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required - will use existing FastAI v2, PyTorch, and project dependencies already defined in environment.yml.
