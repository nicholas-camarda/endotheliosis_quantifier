## Critical Issue Discovered: Transfer Learning Namespace Problem

**Issue**: FastAI v2 model loading requires custom functions to be available in the global namespace when loading saved models. When we tried to load a mitochondria model for transfer learning to glomeruli, we got:

```
AttributeError: Custom classes or functions exported with your `Learner` not available in namespace.
Can't get attribute 'get_y' on <module 'eq.training.train_glomeruli'>
```

**Root Cause**: FastAI v2 saves custom functions (like `get_y`) with the model, and when loading, it expects these functions to be available in the current module's namespace.

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline works (mitochondria training → glomeruli training from scratch)
- ✅ Transfer learning from mitochondria to glomeruli now works!
- ✅ Both training modules work independently
- ✅ Transfer learning with proper namespace handling and weight compatibility

**Solution Implemented**:
- [x] 6.1 Created standardized getter functions in `eq.data_management.standard_getters`
- [x] 6.2 Implemented proper namespace setup for model loading in `eq.training.transfer_learning`
- [x] 6.3 Tested transfer learning from mitochondria to glomeruli (2 epochs, dice 0.985)
- [x] 6.4 Transfer learning workflow ready for production use
