# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate the entire Endotheliosis Quantifier codebase from FastAI v1 to v2 to fix compatibility issues and enable modern deep learning capabilities. This involves converting data pipelines from SegmentationDataLoaders to DataBlock approach, updating all training and inference modules with v2 APIs, fixing import relocations, and validating the complete end-to-end pipeline works with real medical data.

Progress (2025-09-03):
- Prerequisite complete: Data processing validated; CLI `eq process-data` produces `derived_data/`
- Logging stability: Duplicate logs eliminated; verbosity flags respected without duplication
- DataBlock migration complete: Legacy loaders replaced with FastAI v2 DataBlock API; training script updates next
- Training modules updated: Both `train_mitochondria.py` and `train_glomeruli.py` have FastAI v2 APIs and CLI interfaces
- Data structure consistency: All datasets now use consistent `image_patches/` + `mask_patches/` structure
- TIF stack processing: Fixed to handle multi-page TIF files and extract individual images/masks
- Code consolidation: Removed redundant files, cleaned up imports, simplified architecture
- **END-TO-END PIPELINE PROVEN**: Complete pipeline from derived data → mitochondria training → glomeruli training works
- **TRANSFER LEARNING FIXED**: Implemented proper namespace handling and weight compatibility for mitochondria → glomeruli transfer learning
 - **OUTPUT STRUCTURE STANDARDIZED**: All training scripts now use consistent `models/segmentation/` directory structure with centralized constants
