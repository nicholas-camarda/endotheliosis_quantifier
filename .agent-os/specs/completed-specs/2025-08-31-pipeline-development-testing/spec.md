> Spec: Pipeline Development and Testing
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Develop and test the endotheliosis quantifier pipeline as a new user would experience it, ensuring each component (data ingestion, model training, inference, and evaluation) works independently with good reusable and scalable code practices. The goal is to create a robust, testable pipeline that can be run end-to-end by new users while maintaining modularity for development and debugging.

## User Stories

### New User Pipeline Testing

As a new user, I want to run the complete endotheliosis quantifier pipeline step-by-step, so that I can verify the system works correctly and understand how each component functions independently.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
1. Install the package and verify environment setup
2. Run data ingestion and preprocessing with sample data
3. Train mitochondria segmentation model from scratch
4. Train glomeruli segmentation model using transfer learning
5. Run inference on test data
6. Evaluate model performance and generate metrics
7. Run the complete production pipeline end-to-end

### Independent Component Development

As a developer, I want to develop and test each pipeline component independently, so that I can ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability without affecting other components.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
1. Develop data loading and preprocessing modules with comprehensive error handling
2. Create training pipelines with configurable parameters and logging
3. Build inference engines with proper model loading and validation
4. Implement evaluation frameworks with standardized metrics and reporting
5. Ensure each component can be tested in isolation with mock data

### Scalable Code Architecture

As a developer, I want to implement reusable and scalable code practices, so that the pipeline can handle different data sizes, model architectures, and deployment scenarios.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
1. Design modular interfaces between pipeline components
2. Implement configuration management for different use cases
3. Create abstract base classes for extensible functionality
4. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring throughout the pipeline
5. Ensure hardware-aware execution with fallback mechanisms

## Spec Scope

1. **Data Ingestion Module** - Robust data loading, validation, and preprocessing with support for multiple image formats and annotation types
2. **Model Training Pipeline** - Configurable training workflows for both mitochondria and glomeruli models with transfer learning capabilities
3. **Inference Engine** - Efficient model loading and prediction generation with batch processing support
4. **Evaluation Framework** - Comprehensive metrics calculation, visualization, and reporting for model performance assessment
5. **Pipeline Orchestration** - End-to-end pipeline execution with proper error handling and progress tracking
6. **Testing Infrastructure** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for each component with realistic test data
7. **Configuration Management** - YAML-based configuration for different training scenarios and hardware configurations
8. **Hardware Optimization** - Automatic hardware detection and optimization for MPS, CUDA, and CPU execution

## Out of Scope

- Web interface development or API endpoints
- Real-time inference capabilities
- Multi-user authentication and access control
- Cloud deployment automation
- Advanced visualization dashboards beyond basic plotting
- Integration with external databases or data warehouses

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Pipeline Components** - Each component (data, training, inference, evaluation) can be run independently with proper error handling and logging
2. **End-to-End Pipeline Execution** - Complete pipeline runs successfully from data ingestion to final quantification results
3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. **New User Experience** - Clear documentation and examples that allow new users to run the pipeline successfully
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Code structure that supports easy extension, modification, and deployment to different environments
