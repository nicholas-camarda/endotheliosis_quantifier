# Codebase Assessment

This document assesses the current endotheliosis quantifier codebase against the pipeline development and testing requirements specified in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-pipeline-development-testing/spec.md

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Well-Structured Architecture**: The codebase follows a clear modular structure with separate packages for different pipeline components
2. **CLI Interface**: Comprehensive CLI with subcommands for different pipeline stages
3. **Hardware Awareness**: Automatic hardware detection and MPS/CUDA support with fallback mechanisms
4. **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration system for different training scenarios
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Organized test structure with unit, integration, and evaluation test suites
