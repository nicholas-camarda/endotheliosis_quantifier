# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Repo Rename to endotheliosis_quantifier and Conda Env Standardization (eq)
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: In Progress

## Overview
Standardize repository naming to `endotheliosis_quantifier` and align the Conda environment to `eq`, updating documentation and references without breaking existing users.

## User Stories
### Research maintainer updates project naming
As a maintainer, I want the repository and environment to have consistent names, so that installation instructions are simple and reproducible across macOS and Windows.

### Contributor follows updated setup with minimal friction
As a contributor, I want clear, minimal steps to activate the correct environment, so that I can run the pipeline and tests without troubleshooting naming mismatches.

## Spec Scope
1. **Repository Rename** - Plan and document renaming `endotheliosisQuantifier_LEARN` to `endotheliosis_quantifier` with git remote guidance.
2. **Conda Env Standardization** - Ensure `environment.yml` name is `eq`; update docs and scripts to reference `eq`.
3. **Documentation Update** - Update README and `.agent-os/product` docs with new names and commands.
4. **Non-destructive Migration Notes** - Provide reversible steps and GitHub rename/redirect guidance.

## Out of Scope
- Code refactors unrelated to naming.
- Packaging conversion to `src/eq` (tracked separately in roadmap).

## Expected Deliverable
1. A documented, testable rename and env alignment procedure that preserves remotes and enables a clean `conda env create -f environment.yml` â†’ `conda activate eq` flow.
2. Updated docs reflecting the new names and commands.
