# Spec Summary (Lite)

Review, reimplement, and enhance the existing glomeruli transfer learning and evaluation pipeline to ensure it works reliably with current code standards. While a pretrained model exists from previous implementation, the code needs to be rebuilt to mirror the successful mitochondria approach, enabling users to train glomeruli models through transfer learning and evaluate their performance on preeclampsia validation data.
