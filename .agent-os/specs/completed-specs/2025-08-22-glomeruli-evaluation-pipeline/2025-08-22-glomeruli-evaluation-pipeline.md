# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Glomeruli Evaluation Pipeline
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Review, reimplement, and enhance the existing glomeruli transfer learning and evaluation pipeline to ensure it works reliably with current code standards. While a pretrained glomeruli model exists from previous implementation, the transfer learning code needs to be reviewed and rebuilt to mirror the successful mitochondria approach, enabling users to train glomeruli segmentation models through transfer learning from mitochondria-pretrained weights and then evaluate their performance on preeclampsia validation data.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All development, testing, and execution MUST be performed with the 'eq' conda environment activated.**

## User Stories

### Glomeruli Transfer Learning and Evaluation

As a researcher, I want to review and reimplement the existing glomeruli transfer learning pipeline to ensure it works reliably, then train glomeruli segmentation models through transfer learning from mitochondria-pretrained weights and evaluate their performance on preeclampsia validation data, so that I can leverage existing knowledge and assess model quality for glomeruli segmentation tasks with current code standards.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
1. Review existing glomeruli transfer learning implementation to understand current state and identify issues
2. Reimplement the transfer learning pipeline to mirror the successful mitochondria approach
3. Load the mitochondria-pretrained model as the starting point for transfer learning
4. Use the preeclampsia dataset training/validation split already configured in `configs/glomeruli_finetuning_config.yaml`
5. Train the glomeruli segmentation model through transfer learning on the preeclampsia data
6. Evaluate the trained model using the same metrics as mitochondria (Dice Score, IoU Score, Pixel Accuracy)
7. Generate sample prediction visualizations and quantitative performance summaries
8. Save results with proper testing indicators for QUICK_TEST mode

## Spec Scope

1. **Code Review and Analysis** - Review existing glomeruli transfer learning implementation to understand current state and identify issues
2. **Transfer Learning Reimplementation** - Reimplement glomeruli training through transfer learning from mitochondria-pretrained model using current code standards
3. **Dataset Integration** - Integrate with existing preeclampsia training/validation data configuration and loading
4. **Training Pipeline** - Create training workflow that mirrors mitochondria approach but adapted for glomeruli transfer learning
5. **Evaluation Metrics** - Implement identical evaluation methodology to mitochondria (Dice, IoU, Pixel Accuracy)
6. **Sample Visualization** - Generate 4-sample comparison plots showing image, ground truth, and prediction
7. **Quantitative Analysis** - Process all validation samples and provide comprehensive performance statistics
8. **Testing Indicators** - Include clear labeling for testing runs and QUICK_TEST mode

## Out of Scope

- Model retraining or fine-tuning functionality
- New dataset preparation or annotation
- Additional evaluation metrics beyond the proven mitochondria approach
- Integration with other pipeline stages
- Real-time evaluation or streaming capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Reviewed and Reimplemented Transfer Learning Pipeline** - A working glomeruli training and evaluation stage built with current code standards that can be integrated into the existing segmentation pipeline
2. **Functional Training Workflow** - A reliable transfer learning implementation that mirrors the successful mitochondria approach
3. **Comprehensive Performance Metrics** - Quantitative evaluation results including Dice, IoU, and Pixel Accuracy scores with statistical summaries
4. **Visual Validation Outputs** - Sample prediction plots and evaluation summaries with proper testing indicators
