# 2025-08-26 Recap: Model Retraining Infrastructure Organization

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-model-retraining-infrastructure/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully completed the first phase of infrastructure reorganization for the model retraining system, establishing a clean and logical directory structure that separates concerns and eliminates redundancy. The reorganization focused on consolidating scattered functionality into dedicated modules while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring all tests pass.

**Completed Infrastructure Tasks:**
- **Core Directory Cleanup**: Moved data loading, preprocessing, and model loading functions to appropriate modules, keeping only constants and abstract interfaces in core
- **Data Management Consolidation**: Created dedicated data_management module and moved all data-related functionality from scattered locations
- **Processing Module Unification**: Consolidated all image processing functions into a single processing module with unified API
- **Training Infrastructure**: Created dedicated training module and moved training scripts from models/ and pipeline/ directories
- **Inference Infrastructure**: Created dedicated inference module and moved inference scripts from pipeline/ directory

## Context

Implement FastAI v2 compatible retraining scripts for both mitochondria and glomeruli models, and reorganize training infrastructure to separate training scripts from pipeline execution scripts. Create mitochondria retraining script based on historical approach, establish proper training workflow with validation monitoring, and ensure new models integrate with existing inference pipeline to achieve expected 70-90%+ detection rates.
