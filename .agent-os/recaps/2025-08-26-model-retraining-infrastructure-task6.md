# 2025-08-26 Recap: Task 6 - Clean Up Models and Pipeline Directories

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-model-retraining-infrastructure/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully completed the cleanup and reorganization of the models and pipeline directories to establish clear separation of concerns and eliminate mixed functionality. The models directory now contains only the essential FastAI segmenter architecture, while the pipeline directory focuses solely on orchestration and production execution scripts. All redundant training scripts, demo files, and utility functions have been moved to their appropriate locations in the new directory structure.

**Completed Actions:**
- Removed training script from models directory (moved to training/ in previous tasks)
- Moved data_loader.py from models/ to data_management/
- Removed demo script run_complete_mito_pipeline.py from pipeline/
- Moved extract_model_weights.py from pipeline/ to utils/
- Updated all imports and references throughout the codebase
- Verified clean, focused directory structure with single responsibilities

## Context

Implement FastAI v2 compatible retraining scripts for both mitochondria and glomeruli models, and reorganize training infrastructure to separate training scripts from pipeline execution scripts. Create mitochondria retraining script based on historical approach, establish proper training workflow with validation monitoring, and ensure new models integrate with existing inference pipeline to achieve expected 70-90%+ detection rates.
