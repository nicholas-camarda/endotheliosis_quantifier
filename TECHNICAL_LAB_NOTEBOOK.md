# Technical Lab Notebook: Endotheliosis Quantifier

**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Project**: Endotheliosis Quantifier (EQ)  
**Purpose**: Automated quantification of endotheliosis in preeclampsia histology images  

## Executive Summary

The Endotheliosis Quantifier is a deep learning pipeline designed to automatically quantify endotheliosis severity in preeclampsia histology images. The system uses a two-stage approach: first training a mitochondria segmentation model on electron microscopy data, then transferring this knowledge to segment glomeruli in light microscopy images for endotheliosis quantification. The complete pipeline includes ROI identification through segmentation followed by regression modeling to predict endotheliosis scores (0-3) like those described in [Camarda et al. 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11938066/).

## Project Overview

### What is Endotheliosis?

Endotheliosis is a pathological condition affecting the glomerular endothelium, characterized by:
- **Swelling of endothelial cells** in glomerular capillaries
- **Loss of fenestrations** (small pores) in the endothelium
- **Cytoplasmic vacuolization** and organelle changes
- **Reduced filtration capacity** leading to proteinuria

**Mouse Model Context**: The Endotheliosis Quantifier is designed to analyze endotheliosis in mouse glomeruli, providing a valuable tool for preclinical research and drug development studies.

### Clinical Problem

**Manual Assessment Challenges**:
- Time-consuming manual examination by pathologists
- Subjective interpretation leading to inter-observer variability
- Inconsistent grading scales across institutions
- Limited quantitative metrics for severity assessment

**Research Needs**:
- Objective, quantitative measures of endotheliosis severity in mouse models
- Standardized assessment protocols for preclinical studies
- Large-scale analysis capabilities for drug development
- Correlation with experimental outcomes and treatment responses

### Solution Approach

The Endotheliosis Quantifier addresses these challenges through:

1. **Innovative Two-Stage Training**: First train on mitochondria to learn substructure and line features, then transfer to glomeruli
2. **ROI Identification**: Deep learning models to identify and segment mouse glomeruli regions of interest
3. **Regression Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict endotheliosis severity scores (0-3) in mouse tissue
4. **Quantitative Analysis**: Mathematical metrics to quantify endotheliosis severity in preclinical models
5. **Standardized Assessment**: Consistent, objective evaluation across mouse samples
6. **Scalable Processing**: Batch processing of large mouse histology datasets

## Data Pipeline

### Input Data Types

**Electron Microscopy (EM) Data**:
- **Source**: Lucchi et al. 2012 mitochondria dataset
- **Format**: High-resolution EM images with mitochondria annotations
- **Purpose**: Training base segmentation model for general feature extraction
- **Characteristics**: High contrast, detailed cellular structures

**Light Microscopy (LM) Data**:
- **Source**: Mouse glomeruli histology samples
- **Format**: H&E stained kidney tissue sections from mouse models
- **Purpose**: Target domain for endotheliosis quantification
- **Characteristics**: Lower resolution, different staining patterns, mouse tissue morphology

### Data Processing Workflow

1. **Image Acquisition**: Raw histology images in TIF/PNG/JPEG formats
2. **Quality Control**: Validation of image quality and format
3. **Patchification**: Division into 256×256 pixel patches for processing
4. **Mask Generation**: Creation of binary masks for training data
5. **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, zoom, flip, warp, and lighting variations
6. **Normalization**: ImageNet normalization for transfer learning compatibility

### Data Structure

```

├── image_patches/          # 256x256 image patches
├── mask_patches/           # 256x256 binary masks

## Model Architecture

### U-Net with ResNet Encoder

**Architecture Choice**: U-Net selected for:
- **Skip Connections**: Preserves fine-grained spatial information
- **Multi-scale Features**: Captures both local and global patterns
- **Medical Imaging Proven**: Established success in medical segmentation

**Encoder**: ResNet34 backbone for:
- **Pretrained Features**: ImageNet pretrained weights for transfer learning
- **Efficient Training**: Faster convergence with pretrained features
- **Robust Features**: Generalizable feature representations

### Binary Segmentation Approach

**FastAI v2 Best Practice**: Treat binary segmentation as 2-class multiclass problem

```python
learn = unet_learner(
    dls, 
    resnet34, 
    n_out=2,  # 2 classes: background (0) + foreground (1)
    metrics=Dice,  # Standard Dice metric works with multiclass!
)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Model outputs 2 logits per pixel: `[background_logit, foreground_logit]`
- `argmax()` correctly picks the class with highest logit
- Masks with values 0/1 are treated as class indices
- Standard `Dice` metric works perfectly

### Transfer Learning Strategy

**Innovative Two-Stage Training Approach**:

1. **Stage 1 - Mitochondria Pretraining**:
   - Train on EM mitochondria data to learn **substructure and line features**
   - Mitochondria provide rich training data for learning:
     - **Cellular boundaries** and membrane structures
     - **Linear features** and tubular structures
     - **Fine-grained textures** and organelle patterns
     - **Edge detection** and contour recognition
   - Develop robust feature representations for biological structures

2. **Stage 2 - Glomeruli Fine-tuning**:
   - Transfer mitochondria model to glomeruli task
   - **Approach**: Leverage learned substructure features for glomerular segmentation
   - Adapt features to light microscopy domain
   - Fine-tune for glomerular structure recognition using learned line and boundary features

**Why This Approach Works**:
- **Substructure Learning**: Mitochondria training teaches the model to recognize cellular boundaries, membranes, and linear structures
- **Feature Transfer**: These learned features are directly applicable to glomerular structures
- **High Segmentation Accuracy**: Transfer learning achieves better performance compared to training from scratch
- **Domain Adaptation**: EM → LM knowledge transfer with preserved structural understanding
- **Reduced Data Requirements**: Less glomeruli data needed due to pretrained features

**Benefits**:
- **Domain Adaptation**: EM → LM knowledge transfer
- **Faster Convergence**: Pretrained features accelerate training
- **Better Generalization**: Robust feature representations
- **Reduced Data Requirements**: Less glomeruli data needed
- **High Accuracy**: High segmentation accuracy through learned substructure features

## Regression Modeling for Endotheliosis Scoring

### Endotheliosis Severity Scale

While this program was not used in the paper, the scoring standard is based on the research described in [Camarda et al. 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11938066/). Endotheliosis severity is quantified on a 0-3 scale:

- **Score 0**: Normal endothelial cells, no endotheliosis
- **Score 1**: Mild endotheliosis, minimal endothelial swelling
- **Score 2**: Moderate endotheliosis, significant endothelial changes
- **Score 3**: Severe endotheliosis, marked endothelial dysfunction

### Feature Extraction Pipeline
